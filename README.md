### Hi there 👋

I'm Angela Lima, a student at [42 Lisboa](https://www.42lisboa.com/) currently pursuing my studies in software engineering. I'm passionate about learning and some of my hobbies include gaming, programming, futurism, astronomy and philosophy.

#### 🧑‍💻 42 Projects

Here are a few 42 common core projects I've worked on recently:
- <a href="https://github.com/angelamcosta/minitalk" target="_blank"><img width=32 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelamcosta/angelamcosta/main/42_badges/minitalkm.png"> Minitalk</a> - A small data exchange program using UNIX signals. 
- <a href="https://github.com/angelamcosta/so_long" target="_blank"><img width=32 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelamcosta/angelamcosta/main/42_badges/so_longm.png"> So_long</a> - This project is a very small 2D game. The aim of this project is to work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

And here are the projects I'm currently working on:
- <a href="https://github.com/angelamcosta/push_swap" target="_blank"><img width=32 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelamcosta/angelamcosta/main/42_badges/push_swape.png"> Push_swap</a> - The aim of this project is to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.
- <a href="https://github.com/angelamcosta/philosophers" target="_blank"><img width=32 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelamcosta/angelamcosta/main/42_badges/philosopherse.png"> Philosophers</a> - The aim of this project is to learn the basics of threading a process by learning how to create threads and discovering about mutexes.
