### Hi there üëã

I'm Angela Lima, a student at [42 Lisboa](https://www.42lisboa.com/) currently pursuing my studies in software engineering. I'm passionate about learning and some of my hobbies include gaming, programming, futurism, astronomy and philosophy.

#### üßë‚Äçüíª 42 Projects

Here are a few 42 common core projects I've worked on recently:
- <a href="https://github.com/angelamcosta/minitalk" target="_blank"><img width=32 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelamcosta/angelamcosta/main/42_badges/minitalkm.png"> Minitalk</a> - A small data exchange program using UNIX signals. 
- <a href="https://github.com/angelamcosta/so_long" target="_blank"><img width=32 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelamcosta/angelamcosta/main/42_badges/so_longm.png"> So_long</a> - This project is a very small 2D game. The aim of this project is to work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.
- <a href="https://github.com/angelamcosta/push_swap" target="_blank"><img width=32 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelamcosta/angelamcosta/main/42_badges/push_swapm.png"> Push_swap</a> - The aim of this project is to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.

And here are the projects I'm currently working on:

- <a href="https://github.com/angelamcosta/philosophers" target="_blank"><img width=32 src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelamcosta/angelamcosta/main/42_badges/philosophersn.png"> Philosophers</a> - The aim of this project is to learn the basics of threading a process by learning how to create threads and discovering about mutexes.
